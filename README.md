This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## For the grader

I coded for 4 viewports:
iPhone 5/6/7/8/X (portrait/landscape) [should match blueprint]
iPad (1024x768, landscape/portrait) [two column mapview]
iPad Pro (1024x1366, landscape/portrait) [two column mapview]
web (width > 1367) [slide out mapview]

For the internets view I added an image of the blueprint because no assets or layout information was provided. This view is necessary to demonstrate the common header footer and event broadcasting.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
